Features: 
-	Court sheet layout, from 6am to 9pm on a 30mins time slot, with 12 different courts.(HIGH PRIORITY)
-	Add lesson form, which allows the pro to input a lesson (member_name, pro_name, duration and time).  (HIGH PRIORITY)
    o	Prevent overlap from double booking the same pro at the same time, with the option of modifying and moving pros around if needed. 
    o	Every pro has to type the name of the member and click to confirm. 
    o	For billing, each pro will be linked to a specific rate, which would be charged ro every member after the lesson is marked as done, with a ‚Äúsecurity message‚Äù to confirm that the lesson has been completed and ready to be charged.  
-	Add reservation, for regular member reservations. 
    o	Members can see the lessons, but specific information is hidden, so they can only see the availability of the courts. (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
-	Show the lesson form in the calendar in different colors with the pro name, so everyone can different themselves better, as well as the regular reservations. (HIGH PRIORITY)
-	Done/Cancel button for the lessons, as well as a remove or add button for group clinics. 
    o	FUTURE: we can add a way where members can enter the clinics by their own and cancel by their own. If the cancel within 24hrs, the cancellation police can come in play and not allow them to cancel. (HIGH PRIORITY)
-	Different logins for admins and pros, and for members. (LOW PRIORITY)
-	Local storage for now, but database in the future. (LOW PRIORITY)
-	Emails and text reminders for lessons and upcoming events. (LOW PRIORITY)
-	Able to charge apparel, grips, restrings, racquets or any other product that the club offers different from the lessons. (LOW PRIORITY.
-	Form of cancelling, deleting, and confirming lessons, which will be in the future linked to the billing of the lessons directly to the members account. 
-	FUTURE: can work as the hours schedule for the pros and to get paid. Much easier for organization.
